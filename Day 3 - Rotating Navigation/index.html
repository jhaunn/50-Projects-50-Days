               Shonen Jump Comics, Ltd., officially stylized SHONEN JUMP and abbreviated SJ, was a shōnen manga anthology published in
               North America by Viz Media. It debuted in November 2002 with the first issue having a January 2003 cover date. Based on
               Shueisha's popular Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Shonen Jump is retooled for English readers and the American
               audience, including changing it from a weekly publication to a monthly one. It features serialized chapters from four
               manga series, and articles on Japanese language and culture, as well as manga, anime, video games, and figurines. Prior
               to the magazine's launch, Viz launched an extensive marketing campaign to promote it and help it succeed where previous
               manga anthologies published in North America had failed. Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz to help fund the
               venture, and Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors became promotional partners in the magazine.

               In conjunction with the magazine, Viz launched new imprints for releasing media related to the series presented in the
               magazine, and other shōnen works. This includes two new manga imprints, an anime DVD imprint, a fiction line for
               releasing light novels, a label for fan and data books, and a label for the release of art books.

               Targeted towards young adult males, the first issue required three printings to meet consumer demand, with over 300,000
               copies sold. It was awarded the ICv2 "Comic Product of the Year" award in December 2002, and continued to enjoy high
               sales with a monthly circulation of 215,000 in 2008. Approximately half of its circulation comes from subscriptions
               rather than store sales. After the end of its physical circulation, sealed polybagged issues of Shonen Jump are now
               considered highly sought after among fans and comic book collectors.

               Shonen Jump published its final issue in April 2012 when Viz decided to focus on a weekly digital manga anthology.
               Weekly Shonen Jump (initially named Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha) launched in January 2012. Based on Shueisha's popular
               Japanese magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump, Weekly Shonen Jump is an attempt to provide English readers with easily
               accessible, affordable, and officially licensed editions of the latest installments of popular Shōnen Jump manga soon
               after their release in Japan, as an alternative to popular bootleg scanlation services.

               Viz Media published its final digital issue of Weekly Shonen Jump and launched the Shonen Jump digital vault on December
               10, 2018, providing access to a limited number of free digital chapters and a subscription service to access their back
               catalogue of Shonen Jump titles. A global version of Shonen Jump+ was also launched on January 28, 2019 called Manga
               Plus by Shueisha
